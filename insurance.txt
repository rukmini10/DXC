====>Insurance Contract
It is one of the largest contract
insurace is such a kind of contract where 2 parties agree 

defined as an agreement between two parties whereby one party
 is called an insurer and the other is called insured

==>Essentials of valid contract

1) which any contract requires - 2 or more parties
eg: marriage , we cant do with out 2 persons
2) free consent- because of fear , or forcefull 
one party is not agreeing the terms and conditions then it is not valid contract
3) lawful objective- any contract we are making that could be lawful and legal 
it is intention-objective
eg:
Q)why cant we buy insurance for lotter?
Why because it is a gambling and 50-50 chance and uncertainity
and unlawful of activity and more chances of loses 

4)lawful consideration-
both party should be mutual benifit
eg:buying a gold from u ,acqviring gold from smogling and this is at 50% discount
and not avare of this is smugling and this is still not valid 
because doing illegal activity by one party

5)offer and acceptance-
one party will contract and another party accept the offer


==>principles of insurance contract
1)Utmost goodfaith-it means trust
The fundamental principle is that both the parties in an insurance contract 
should act in good faith towards each other, i.e. they must provide
 clear and concise information related to the terms and conditions of the contract.

The Insured should provide all the information related to the subject matter, 
and the insurer must give precise details regarding the contract.

Example â€“ Jacob took a health insurance policy. At the time of taking insurance,
 he was a smoker and failed to disclose this fact. Later, he got cancer. 
In such a situation, the Insurance company will not be liable to bear 
the financial burden as Jacob concealed important facts.

at time of insurance taken he is not smoker and in future he is become somker 
then it is utmost good faith we will still provide u claim

what is material facts?
some facts which influences mind of a prudent underwriter - will descide whether to give insurance or not

2) Insurable interest- is said to exist when, due to happening of an
unfortunate event, the proposer stands to suffer a financial loss

eg: nadhini is taking one loan from bank, sadana is gurantee,
sadana is saying if nandini unable to pay means sadana will pay
if anything happens to nandini , sadana needs to pay because she is guranter
buying a insurance policy needs not to be a blood relation

eg: whenever there is financial loss then there will be insurable interest

why i can able to buy insurance for someone?
i can buy insurance by group insurance , leader of the group can buy insurance to all group members

3)Principle of indemnity
insurance is meant to compensate the losses
the mechanism of insurance cannot be used to make profits 
amount of claim cannot be exceed the amount of loss incurred

4)proximate cause
the cause of loss must be proximate or immediate and not remote
if proximate cause of loss is a peril insured against, the insured can recover

when insurance settles the claim they will check proximates the cost
eg:we are living in 3rd floor we have taken insurance for fire, if flood occurs 
and fire has happens then proximate cause was flood and not fire, then claim wont occurs

risk- chances of loss
peril-reason of loss

---->Is insurance a legal contract?
yes
intention is legal
proposer offers - insurer accepts
premium is consideration(profit)
insured must be major with sound mind capacity to contract
insured and insurer are in agrement of same mind and free consent

some one having minor things like BP, having less risk
give insurance but high premium

4.Declined lives
someone have high bp,sugar,cancer is occuring to every one,,moral hazard,occupationsl hazard
company will say no we dont give insurance to people

declines applications
determines appropriate premium
--Needs to take decision to provide insurance coverage or not is commonly referred to as an underwritting

===>UNderwriters Decisions
1.Acceptance at ordinary rates
while applying insurance company tells to pay 10laksh premium, underwriter will  will accept if condition is good and fit 

2.Acceptance with an extra
if you are having some health conditions then underwritter will ask you to pay some extra premium

you have bought the policy in medical, you have hyper contrl
underwriter will say , we will give you policy, 
but if you die with first year due to hyper tension
we will cut 80% lien and gives remaining
next 2nd year 60%
3rd year 40%
4th-20%
5th - 0
this is only for 5 years
lien is temporary condition not permanent

4.Acceptance with a restrictive clause
this is a permanent condition
if you are having high sugar
if anythings happens due to sugar we will not give u anything
this is a loss for company

5.Decline or postpone
decline means underwritten descides if you have big disease
some times postpone the policy , i.e gives you time to control ur sugar conditions

  again 2 types
->husband has life insurance

----------------------------------------------
==>Pricing and valuation in life insurance

for every age/policy term premium changes 
how calculation/table is generated?

->Premium 
if anyone is buying a life insurance he needs to pay insrance
if anyone is notable to pay canceling the policy

->Rebate
insurance company will offers some discounts
according to bigger premium less needs to pay  annually
 to attract customers if taking high premium
 
two such rebates are
  -for sum assured 
if u buy larger sum assured company will provide less premium
  -for mode of premium

->Extra charges
if person is proposing for insurance suffers from certain health like heart/diabeties ,
it can pose a hazard to his life.such a life is considered as sub standard

any insurer may offer certain benifits under a policy which are available on payment of an extra premium
------------------------------------------------------------------------

==>factors affecting pricing of life insurance
-Mortality
risk of death claim
for paying death benifit , company will charge this from us
cover on yearly basis and is ususal charged monthly
deducted from unit cancellation

-Age of life insured
until and unless without age we cant descide the premium of the person

-interest rate
if interest rate goes up , premium goes down , because profit increased

-Management expenses
if management expenses rises, go down premium also go down

-Reserves
those money which have insurance company 
like if some wars occurs so many will die, company need to keep reservs and surplus 
if reservs then premium is low

-Bonus Loading

---------------------------------------------
==>risk premium
How mortality is calculated?
if the mortality rate for age 35 is 0.0035 it implies that out of every 1000 people
who are alive as on age 35,3.5 (35 out of 10000) are expected to die between age 35 and 36

ans: 
0.0035*1000(sum assured)=3.50 per thousand sum assured

the above cost may be also call risk premium higher the age , higher will be risk premium

-------------------------------
-->Net premium
Estimates of mortality and interest giveen
which estimates of present value of future claims

Assuming a person is proposing for 20 lakhs of insurance,
risk premium shall be 3500/-(assumption)

Assuming interest oppurtunity by insurer be 5%  then
interest rate will be 3500*5%=175/-

hence net premium : risk premium less interest
3500(less) 175=3325/-

-------------------------------------------------
-->Gross premium
it is like
gross = net premium + an amount called loading
-loading means expenses
there are 3 considerations / guiling principles that needs to be borne in mind when determining amount of loading

--Guiding principles of determinign amount of loading
adequacy
equity-higher the summation higher the loadin, 
lower the summation lower the loading
competitiveness

Expenses and reserves
---------------------
agents training and recruitment
commisions of agents
staff salaries
office accomodations
office stationary
electricity charges
other miscellanaeous etc

gross premium=net premium+loading for expenses+loading for contingencies+bonus loading
